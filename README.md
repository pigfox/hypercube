# Hypercube

A Go simulation of an n-dimensional hypercube object.

## Overview

This code simulates a hypercube (starting with a 4D tesseract) and extends to n-dimensional space. It defines the structure, simulates rotation, and projects the object into 3D space for visualization purposes.

### Initial 4D Hypercube (Tesseract)
- **Vertices**: 16 (each coordinate is either -1 or 1)
- **Edges**: 32 (connecting vertices that differ in exactly one coordinate)

### Core Functionality
- **Creation**: Generates the hypercube structure.
- **Rotation**: Supports rotation in XY and ZW planes (ZW is 4D-specific).
- **Projection**: Implements a simple perspective projection from 4D to 3D space.
- **Simulation**: Rotates the hypercube over time, projects 4D coordinates to 3D, and prints sample vertex positions.

### Extending to Higher Dimensions (n > 4)
To extend the simulation beyond 4D, you can:
- Make the dimension configurable in `PointND`.
- Programmatically generate 2^n vertices.
- Add rotation planes (e.g., XY, XZ, XW, YZ, YW, ZW, etc.).
- Adjust the projection function for higher dimensions.

### Output
The simulation outputs the hypercubeâ€™s rotation through 4D space, with coordinates projected to 3D. In a real application, these coordinates would typically be fed into a graphics library (e.g., OpenGL) for visualization rather than just printed.

#### Sample Output
Frame at t=0.00
Sample projected vertices (first 4):
Vertex 0: [-0.50, -0.50, -0.50]
Vertex 1: [-0.50, -0.50, 0.50]
Vertex 2: [-0.50, 0.50, -0.50]
Vertex 3: [-0.50, 0.50, 0.50]
Number of edges: 32

Frame at t=0.10
Sample projected vertices (first 4):
Vertex 0: [-0.52, -0.47, -0.50]
Vertex 1: [-0.52, -0.47, 0.50]
Vertex 2: [-0.47, 0.52, -0.50]
Vertex 3: [-0.47, 0.52, 0.50]
Number of edges: 32


## Key Features

- **Configurable Dimensions**: The `NewHypercube` function accepts a dimension parameter, supporting any number of dimensions (memory-limited).
- **Efficient Vertex Generation**: Uses bit operations to generate 2^n vertices, with coordinates set to -1 or 1.
- **Edge Generation**: Creates edges between vertices differing in exactly one coordinate, leveraging bitwise XOR for efficiency.
- **Generalized Rotation**: Implements rotation across all possible pairs of dimensions (n*(n-1)/2 planes) with varying speeds.
- **Scalable Projection**: Projects to 3D using the first three dimensions when available, applying a simple perspective projection based on the last dimension.
- **Memory Consideration**: Theoretically supports thousands of dimensions, though practical limits depend on available memory due to exponential vertex growth (2^n).

### Usage Examples
```go
// For a 10-dimensional hypercube
hypercube := NewHypercube(10)  // Creates 1024 vertices

// For a 1000-dimensional hypercube
hypercube := NewHypercube(1000)  // Creates 2^1000 vertices (beware memory!)
```
